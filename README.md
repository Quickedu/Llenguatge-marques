# Mark Language folder :D

Here I have all the works I did with mark language (html5, css, a bit of JS, XML, JSON, etc)

The first folder with the easiest programs is [Xml_Json_MkDown](/Xml_Json_MkDown). Here you have a simple task we did about making a file of each type.

Then, the [HTML5_CSS](/HTML5_CSS) folder is where we practice a bit of HTML5 and css (as it says in the name xd), and there's also a bit of JS we did there (in the JS folder you'll find a exercice about apis we did. I used a Digimon API ðŸ‘¾). Of course, in the CSS exercices, you have HTML and CSS, and in the HTML there's only HTML.

In the folder [Serialitzacio](/Serialitzacio) we did some exercices about serializacion of Json and XML. The JsonYamlConverterApi project don't work at all, but there it is xd

[ValidaciÃ³/XML](/ValidaciÃ³/XML) folder is about XML validation schemas, and in [XML](/XML) there's a XML builder I made, where you can introduce the data of your XML (following the template) and it will create itself.
